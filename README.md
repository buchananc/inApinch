# In A Pinch #
> In a Pinch provides a quick and simple way to find a clean bathroom when you need to go, on the go. Just open the app and you will get a display of all the toilets near you. Like your experience?  Would never step foot in that retsroom again?  Write a review to promote or warn others!

## Getting Started ## 
<br />
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:
<br />
Clone the In A Pinch repository (https://github.com/taw1313/inApinch) and then create a MySQL database called dookiedb.
<br />
<br />
## Screenshots ## 
<br />
Welcome to the In A Pinch, mobile responsive application! Let's start the user experience from teh beginning:
<br />
After the website loads, the user can sign in to leave a restroom review, or they can continue as a guest.
<br />
![signinscreen]("/public/images/screenshots/SignInScreen.png")
<br />
Once the user finds their location, they can click on a pin to read previous reviews.
<br />
![seepriorreviews]("/public/images/screenshots/SeePriorReviews.png")
<br />
At this point, they can close the modal to review other locations, or sign in to leave their own bathroom experience.
<br />
![addareviewnocomments]("/public/images/screenshots/AddAReviewNoComments.png")
<br />
To leave a review, the user will need to rate the bathroom and write a comment.
<br />
![addareview]("/public/images/screenshots/AddAReview.png")
<br />
Afterwards, their review will be saved in our database and will update the customer reviews modal.
<br />
![reviewadded]("/public/images/screenshots/ReviewAdded.png")
<br />
If a location is showing, the user can 'add a location' or 'drop a pin' on a location so they can highlight the first experience.
<br />
![addalocation]("/public/images/screenshots/AddALocation.png")
<br />
Once the user has finished using our web application, they can finally 'Sign Out', until they return to check out local restrooms closeby again.
<br />
![signout]("/public/images/screenshots/SignOut.png")
<br />
<br />
